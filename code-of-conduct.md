# Contributor Code of Conduct

### Community
We as contributors to this project aim to facilitate a welcoming and judgement-free community. We welcome people of all backgrounds, experience, sexual orientation, gender and religion to participate in the development of this project. We pledge to make the development experience of those who choose to contribute as seamless, and harassment-free as possible. 

### Expectations of Behaviour
All contributors must behave in a respectful, orderly and welcoming manner. We endeavour to ensure that all contributors are treated with respect, and any form of discrimination, harassment or derogatory remarks will not be tolerated by the project maintainers. 

Behaviour that we believe will serve to produce a more productive environment includes, but is not limited to:  
  
- The provision and acceptance of genuine constructive criticism
- Acting in the best interests of the community as a whole
- Being respectful to differing points of view, and working to understand and be empathetic towards a diversity of opinions

Unacceptable behaviour includes but is not limited to:  
  
- Unprofessional or disrespectful language in communication
- Harassment
- Discrimination
- Personal attacks or condescending remarks 
- The use of sexual remarks or other forms of sexual behaviour

Any contributor found to be engaging in any of the behaviours above will be expelled from the project and may face other repercussions.

### Enforcement
If any instances of abusive, harassing or other unacceptable behavior are noticed, 
We will first try to resolve it by a team discussion to discuss the unacceptable behaviour.
If this is not working, it will result in a discussion with a TA or Lab Instructor.
