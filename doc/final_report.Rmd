## Aim and Summary

The main predictive question we wish to answer is what we can expect a person's salary to be in the US, given a certain professional history (such as years of experience, industry, or age). We will use a linear regression model to do the prediction. In the process, we wish to understand which factors provide the most predictive power when trying to predict a person's salary.

## Methods

The Python [@python] and R [@r] programming languages and the following Python and R packages were used to perform the data analysis and present results: Pandas [@reback2020pandas], Scikit-learn [@pedregosa2011scikit], Altair [@vanderplas2018altair], docopt [@docopt], knitr [@knitr].

As references, we utilized [@jain_2017] for methodological practices regarding linear, ridge and lasso regression, as well as [@Mart√≠n2018] which recommended linear regression for problems similar to the one we are analysing.
