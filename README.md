## Project Proposal 
authors: Cuthbert Chow, Rong Li, Andy Yang
Data analysis to predict manager salaries for DSCI 522(Data Science Workflows); a course in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia 

### About

The main predictive question we wish to answer is what we can expect a manager’s salary to be, given a certain professional history (such as years of experience, industry, country, or age). We will use the linear regression model to do the prediction. In the process, we wish to understand which factors provide the most predictive power when trying to predict a manager’s salary. 

We will generate EDA tables which will list all data features, along with their data types and distributions (i.e. mean, quartiles, etc.) if they are numeric. One EDA figure we will create is a scatterplot matrix of continuous variables against the output variable (salary), and histograms of all the continuous variables which will further help us quantify their distributions.

We would share the results of our analysis in a literate coding document (specifically, a jupyter notebook), which would interleave the resulting figures and tables as well as other code contained in scripts with narrative explanations. 

### Reference:
The dataset we are analysing comes from the “Ask a Manager Salary Survey” from the blog by Alison Green. This dataset contains survey data gathered from managers working in a variety of industries, and can be found here.
