Usually, I teach spring, fall, and summer (fewer courses are allowed to be taught during shorter summer semesters). Sometimes courses are cancelled right before the semester starts (after doing all the prep) or you are only assigned 1 course.  So the estimate given for 52 weeks at full time (for 1 school max classes) is a big estimate and a closer number would be $17,000 (that is if all classes make and I am at the max assigned) because teaching is not all year (16 weeks fall and spring, 8 weeks summer - usually). For me, I teach at multiple colleges to be able to make a ""descent"" amount.",Indiana,Remote,11 - 20 years,11 - 20 years,Master's degree
